*Google OR-Tools*

This repository \([https://github.com/wermelinger/bbv-googleortools](https://github.com/wermelinger/bbv-googleortools)\) contains samples and excercises for constraint optimization with Google OR-Tools using dotnet. 

# 01_SimpleConstraints
This is no excercise but just a basic sample which was showed in the presentation.

It consists of a simple model containing variables with constraints and an optimization. 

# 02_SudokuSolver
This is an excercise to create a solver for Sudokus, as showed in the presentation.
* **SudokuSolver**: contains the solver with helper-classes. Your task is to program the model in `SudokuConstraintsSolver.cs`
* **SudokuSolverTests**: contains unit-tests which are currently failing. Use them to guide you through the implementation of the solver and make them green - one by one.
* **FieldsHelper**: Contains helper methods to deal with the Sudoku-fields

In case you're stuck, you can have a look at the solution: SudokuSolver/Solution

# 03_MinesweeperSolver
This is a more advanced and more open excercise. 
* **MinesweeperSolver**: contains the solver with helper-classes. Your task is to program the model in `MinesweeperConstraintsSolver.cs`
* **MinesweeperSolverTests**: contains unit-tests which are currently failing. Use them and add new ones to guide you through the implementation of the solver and make them green - one by one.
* **Minefield**: Provides useful methods to deal with the minefield
  * `Minefield.GetAllCells()` provides all cells
  * Cells next to mines are of the type `CellWithMineDetector`
  * `Minefield.GetCellsInDetectionRadius(cellWithMineDetector)` provides all cells in the radius of the given cellWithMineDetector
  * Once you found the solution, you can mark a field with a mine: `Minefield.PlaceMine(x, y)`

# Cheat-Sheet
## Create the model: Variables, Constraints, Objectives
|Code|Explanation|
|----|----|
|`var model = new CpModel()`|Creates a model|
|`var x = model.NewIntVar(0, 9, "x")`|Creates a new integer-variable in the model|
|`var constraint = model.Add(x == y)`|Adds a new constraint to the model: x should be equal to y|
|`var constraint = model.Add(LinearExpr.Sum(variables) == 7)`|Adds a new constraint to the model: The sum of the variables should be equal to 7|
|`model.Maximize(x)`|Sets the objective of the model to maximize x|
|`model.AddAllDifferent(variables)`|Adds a global constraint requiring all variables in the list to be different|

## Solve and evaluate
|Code|Explanation|
|----|----|
|`var solver = new CpSolver()`|Creates a solver|
|`var status = solver.Solve(model)`|The solver will search for solutions to the model. The status tells whether none (INFEASIBLE), some (FEASIBLE) or all (OPTIMAL) solutions have been found|
|`solver.Value(x)`|After `Solve(model)` the solution can be inspected|
